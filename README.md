# Snort-IDS-and-Honeypot-Integration
This project aims to enhance network security by deploying and integrating a Pentbox honeypot with a Snort Intrusion Detection System (IDS). This combination will provide a proactive defense mechanism by attracting and analyzing attackers while keeping critical systems protected.

# Installation
1. Virtual Machiine = [Link](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)

2. Kali Linux for Attack = [Link](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-installer-images)

3. Ubuntu OS System for IDS with Snort and Pentbox Honeypot = [Link](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop)

4. Two Routers for Internet Connection and create a Network Infrastruction

# Implementation
1. INSTALL URUNTU (LINUX OS) SYSTEM
   
•	Install Ubuntu on a dedicated machine or virtual machine. This will be used for Snort.
•	A lightweight Linux distribution like Debian is recommended for the honeypot (Pentbox).

3. INSTALL SORT TOOL
   
• Install Snort on the Ubuntu system. This typically involves downloading the Snort package, configuring dependencies, and compiling/installing.
  
5. IP GATHERING
   
•	Gather IP addresses:
o	Identify the IP address of the Ubuntu system where Snort is installed.
o	Determine the IP address that the Pentbox honeypot will use. This IP should be on an isolated network segment.
•	(This step might be better named "Network Configuration")

6. UNZIPPING PENTBOX PACKAGES

•	Unzip the Pentbox package on the Debian system.


7. INSTALLATION PENTBOX HONEYPOT

•	Install Pentbox on the Debian system. This likely involves extracting the Pentbox files and potentially running an installation script.
 
8. CHECKING 0 HOST UP IN ATTACKING MACHINE

•	This step is unclear and requires more context. It seems to refer to a check from the attacker's perspective, verifying that the honeypot appears to be a live host.
•	Clarification is needed on what "0 host up" specifically means.

 
9. SETTING UP  PENTBOX HONEYPOT

•	Configure Pentbox to simulate the desired services (e.g., SSH, Telnet). This involves editing Pentbox configuration files.


10. ACTVATE HONEYPOT ON ANYPOT

•	This step is unclear. It likely refers to starting the Pentbox honeypot service.
•	Clarification is needed on what "ANYPOT" refers to.

 
11. MANUAL CONFIGURATION OF HONEYPOT 

•	This is part of step 7, configuring Pentbox to define its behavior, the services it emulates, and how it interacts with attackers.
 

12. GIVING PORT 

•	Configure the ports that the honeypot services will listen on (e.g., port 22 for SSH, port 23 for Telnet).

 
13. SPECIFYING AND CONFIGUATION IF HONEYPOT BEFORE DEPLOYMENT 

•	This encompasses steps 7, 9, and 10: Setting up Pentbox's services, ports, and other settings before it's put into operation.
 
14. ATTACK

•	Simulate an attack from a separate system to test the honeypot and Snort. This could involve using tools like Nmap, Metasploit, or manual attempts to connect to the honeypot services.

15. AFTER DEPLOYMENT ATTACK

•	This is the same as step 12, attacking the honeypot to see if it works.

16. CAPTURE IN HONEYPOT AND FOUND IP OF ATTACKER

•	Verify that the honeypot (Pentbox) logs the attacker's activity, including their IP address.
•	Also, verify that Snort detects the attack and generates an alert.

# Project Script File: Enhancing Network Security with Snort IDS and Honeypot Integration
Note: This script provides a can run in Linux Operating System

I. Honeypot Setup (Pentbox)
Install Pentbox:

Download Pentbox from a reliable source.

Extract the Pentbox archive.

Navigate to the Pentbox directory.

Make the Pentbox executable.

Example (adapt to your system)
'''
wget https://github.com/some/pentbox.tar.gz
tar -xvf pentbox.tar.gz
cd pentbox
chmod +x pentbox.rb
'''
Configure Honeypot:

Run Pentbox.

Choose "Honeypot" from the main menu.

Select a configuration mode:

Fast Auto Configuration: Quick setup with default settings.

Manual Configuration: Customize settings (port, message, logging, etc.).

If using Manual Configuration:

Specify the listening port (e.g., 80 for HTTP).

Enter a custom message to display to attackers.

Enable/disable logging.

Enable/disable sound alerts.

  # Example (Manual Configuration)
  ./pentbox.rb
  # ... (follow the Pentbox menu prompts)

Isolate Honeypot:

Ensure the honeypot is deployed on an isolated network segment.  This is crucial to prevent attackers from gaining access to your production network.

Use a separate virtual machine, VLAN, or physical network.

Configure firewall rules to restrict traffic to/from the honeypot.

  # Example (iptables - adapt to your firewall)
  # Assuming honeypot IP is 192.168.100.2
  iptables -A FORWARD -i eth0 -s 192.168.100.2 -j DROP  # Block forward from honeypot
  iptables -A FORWARD -i eth0 -d 192.168.100.2 -j DROP  # Block forward to honeypot

II. Snort IDS Setup
Install Snort:

Install Snort and its dependencies.  The exact steps vary depending on your operating system (Linux, Windows, etc.).

  # Example (Ubuntu)
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install snort

Configure Snort:

Configure Snort to capture traffic on the network interface connected to the honeypot network segment.

Edit the Snort configuration file (e.g., /etc/snort/snort.conf).

Define the network variables (HOME_NET, etc.).

Specify the network interface to monitor.

Include the necessary Snort rules.

  # Example (snort.conf)
  ipvar HOME_NET 192.168.100.0/24  # Honeypot network
  ...
  dev eth1  # Interface connected to honeypot network
  include $RULE_PATH/snort.rules # Include rule file.

Write Snort Rules:

Create Snort rules to detect traffic to/from the honeypot.  These rules will generate alerts when attackers interact with the honeypot.

Create a new Snort rule file (e.g., /etc/snort/rules/honeypot.rules).

Write rules to detect specific actions, such as TCP connections to the honeypot's listening port.

Use the Snort rule language.

Include the new rule file in the main Snort configuration file (snort.conf).

  # Example (honeypot.rules)
  alert tcp any any -> $HOME_NET 80 (msg:"ATTACK: Attempted connection to honeypot"; sid:1000001; rev:1;)

Start Snort:

Start Snort in IDS mode, specifying the configuration file and the network interface.

snort -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -i eth1 -A console

III. Integration and Testing
Test the Integration:

From a separate system (the attacker's system), attempt to connect to the honeypot (e.g., using telnet, nmap, or a web browser).

Verify that the honeypot responds as expected (displays the custom message, logs the connection).

Verify that Snort generates an alert when the connection attempt occurs.

Check the Snort alert output (console, log file) for the alert message.

Monitor and Analyze:

Continuously monitor Snort alerts and honeypot logs.

Analyze the attacker's activity to gather information about their TTPs.

Use the collected information to improve your overall security posture.

IV. Further Enhancements (Future Work)
Automated Rule Generation: Develop scripts or tools to automatically generate Snort rules based on the data collected by the honeypot.

Centralized Logging and Analysis: Integrate Snort and honeypot logs with a centralized logging and analysis platform (e.g., ELK stack, Splunk) for better visibility and correlation.

Active Response: Configure Snort to automatically block or respond to attacks detected on the honeypot (use with caution!).

Visualization: Create visualizations of the attack data to gain a better understanding of attacker behavior.

Cloud Integration: Deploy Snort and Honeypot in a cloud environment.
 
# Result : Honeypot and IDS (Snort)
We enhanced its defence against cyberattacks by integrating a honeypot and Intrusion Detection System (IDS). This integration provides proactive threat detection, detailed attack intelligence, improved incident response, and a cost-effective security enhancement by leveraging open-source tools.
•	A dedicated Ubuntu system with Snort IDS for active network traffic monitoring.
•	A separate Debian system with Pentbox honeypot, emulating services on an isolated segment to attract and log attackers.
•	Integrated threat detection: Snort detects attacks on the honeypot, and Pentbox logs attacker details.
•	System testing confirms successful attack attraction, logging, and Snort alerting.
